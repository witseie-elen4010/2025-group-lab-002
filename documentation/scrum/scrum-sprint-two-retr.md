1.	**Sprint Summary**

- Number of user stories planned: 8
- Number of user stories delivered: 6

2.	**What Went Well**

- Improved collaboration and communication through regular check-ins.
- GitHub branches were well-managed with fewer merge conflicts.
- Test coverage was added for major features.

3.	**What Went Wrong**

- This affected the total number of stories marked as completed.
- A few environment-specific issues slowed initial progress.

4.	**What Can Be Improved**
