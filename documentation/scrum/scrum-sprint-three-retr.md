## ðŸ“Œ Sprint 3
## ðŸ“… Date of Meeting: 2025-05-18

1.	**Sprint Summary**

- Number of user stories planned: 8
- Number of user stories delivered: 7

2.	**What Went Well**
- Game flow was established more successfully 
- Better integration of hard coded logic with server and backend
- More test coverage added
- Clear user stories and acceptance tests
- Better communication between team members in terms of what is being worked on

3.	**What Went Wrong**

- Working on different features independently caused lots of merge conflicts when trying to integreate. 
- It took more time than expected to integrate separate features together 
- Implemented voting round separate from giving clues separate from assigning roles etc. All these separate phases needed to be condensed into one game round, resulting in moving a lot of code around and a lot of code being repeated/redundant. 
- Some user stories depended on other stories being completed first, which slowed down development. 
- One team member fell ill and was unable to complete all stories

4.	**What Can Be Improved**
- Ensure any feature that is being implemented works with the overall game flow
- Integrate more often throughout the development process
