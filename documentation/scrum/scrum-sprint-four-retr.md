## ðŸ“Œ Sprint 4
## ðŸ“… Date of Meeting: 2025-05-25

1. **Sprint Summary**
- Number of user stories planned: 8
- Number of user stories delivered: 8


2. **What Went Well**
- Most core functionality was already in place, so the team could focus on polishing, refinement, and quality assurance.
- We successfully implemented and tested Mr White win conditions, completing the final gameplay logic.
- The UI was significantly improved through focused styling updates, consistent feedback states, and layout adjustments across devices.
- Guest login and admin logging features were added, rounding out usability and traceability for real users.
- Despite a team member being unavailable for part of the sprint, remaining members reallocated tasks effectively to keep progress on track.
- Bug fixing and small issue resolution went smoothly.

3. **What Went Wrong**
- One team member was sick during a critical window, which put additional pressure on others to meet the final goals.
- A few tasks, such as additional test coverage and stretch features including scoring, leaderboards, and restarting a game with the same players, were postponed or dropped due to time constraints.

4. **What Can Be Improved**
- Leave more buffer time in final sprint for test writing, documentation updates, and feature freezes.
- Integrate automated testing and coverage reporting earlier in the sprint to avoid last-minute CI/CD fixes.
- Encourage short end-of-day updates during polish sprints to keep momentum and alignment strong when task sizes are smaller.
