# ADR: Use of HTTP Endpoints for Server-Based Room Management

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Although Socket.IO can be used for most interactions, we still require RESTful HTTP endpoints for:
- Initial room creation
- Validating room join requests
- Decoupling logic from the WebSocket lifecycle

This provides a reliable, debuggable foundation, especially during app startup.

## Decision
We will expose the following RESTful routes:

### `POST /api/game/create-room`
Creates a new game room with a generated code.

### `POST /api/game/join-room`
Attempts to join an existing room using a provided code and username.

Both endpoints return structured JSON and can be used by the frontend to initiate gameplay or socket connections.

## Consequences
- Clear separation between transactional (HTTP) and interactive (WebSocket) logic.
- Easier to log, cache, and test HTTP endpoints independently of socket lifecycle.
- Slight increase in initial complexity due to dual communication channels.
