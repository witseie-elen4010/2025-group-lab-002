# ADR: Use of Socket.IO for Real-Time Communication

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and the server to:
- Notify players when a game room is created
- Inform others when a user joins a room
- Prepare for live game state updates (e.g., player movements, scores)

Socket.IO provides a high-level abstraction over WebSockets and fallback mechanisms, making it ideal for this use case.

## Decision
We will use [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) for all real-time interactions, specifically:
- Emitting `createRoom` and `joinRoom` events from the client
- Listening for `roomCreated`, `joinedRoom`, and `errorJoining` responses
- Broadcasting user presence or state changes in future multiplayer game logic

The socket connection is established from the client once the page loads:
```
const socket = io();
```

## Consequences
- We must maintain both HTTP and WebSocket connections in parallel.
- Events will be emitted from both client and server using socket.emit() and socket.on().
- We will need to document and manage Socket.IO event schemas.
