# ADR: Use of Coveralls for Code Coverage Reporting

## Status
Accepted

## Context
As part of our CI/CD pipeline and code quality practices, we require a tool to track test coverage over time and surface coverage metrics on pull requests.

Jest provides built-in code coverage output, but it does not persist results or display coverage trends in a user-friendly way. A third-party coverage service is needed to:
- Track and visualize test coverage history
- Comment on pull requests with coverage impact
- Display coverage badges in the README
- Integrate seamlessly with GitHub Actions

Two popular options are **Codecov** and **Coveralls**. Both are widely used and compatible with Jest coverage reports (`lcov.info` format).

## Decision
We chose **Coveralls** for the following reasons:
- It integrates directly with GitHub Actions and works well with `jest --coverage` output.
- It supports coverage uploads via a simple command-line tool (`coveralls`).
- It is free for public repositories.
- Setup requires minimal configuration: one secret token and a single piping command.
- It is lightweight, mature, and sufficient for our projectâ€™s scale and goals.

To enable this:
- We installed `coveralls` as a development dependency.
- We configured our GitHub Actions workflow to run Jest with `--coverage` and pipe the result to Coveralls.
- We added `COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN` as a GitHub Actions secret.
- We include a coverage badge in the `README.md`.

## Consequences
- CI now uploads coverage data to Coveralls on every push or pull request.
- Coverage percentage and changes will be visible in the Coveralls dashboard. 
- The team can monitor which parts of the code are well tested and ensure new features maintain or improve coverage.
- Adds a small extra step in CI but improves visibility and accountability in testing.
