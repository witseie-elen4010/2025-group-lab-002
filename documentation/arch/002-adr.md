# ADR: Implement Database with Sequelize and PostgreSQL

## Context

Following the initial setup of our Express.js REST API, we needed to implement a proper database solution to replace the in-memory array storage mentioned in ADR-001. The application requires a robust, scalable database that can handle user data, authentication, and future application features.

## Decision

We have decided to implement the database layer using:

- **Database System:** PostgreSQL as our primary database
- **ORM:** Sequelize.js as our Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool
- **Configuration:** Environment-based configuration using dotenv for database credentials

The database configuration will be centralized in `src/config/database.js`, providing a single source of truth for database connections. The setup includes:
- Connection pooling for better performance
- Environment variable-based configuration
- Default fallback values for development
- Disabled SQL query logging in production

## Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - **Type Safety:** Sequelize provides type safety and data validation
  - **Migrations:** Built-in support for database migrations
  - **Relationships:** Easy management of database relationships
  - **Query Building:** Powerful query builder with support for complex queries
  - **Transaction Support:** Built-in support for database transactions
  - **Environment Flexibility:** Easy configuration for different environments (development, testing, production)

- **Cons:**
  - **Learning Curve:** Team members need to learn Sequelize's API and patterns
  - **Performance Overhead:** ORM abstraction layer adds some performance overhead
  - **Complexity:** Additional complexity in the codebase compared to raw SQL
  - **Dependency:** Adds another major dependency to the project

## Status
Accepted

## Summary

We have chosen PostgreSQL as our database system and Sequelize as our ORM tool. This combination provides a robust, scalable solution for our data persistence needs while maintaining good developer experience through type safety and powerful query building capabilities. The implementation allows for easy configuration across different environments and provides a solid foundation for future feature development.
