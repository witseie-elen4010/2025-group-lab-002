# ADR: Set Up Basic REST API with Express

## Context

We are building a backend for a web application, and we need to set up an API to handle HTTP requests from the frontend. This backend needs to expose routes for user authentication, including signup and login functionality.


## Decision

After evaluating several options, we have decided to proceed with the following architecture for the Node.js REST API:

- **Framework:** **Express.js** will be used for setting up handling HTTP requests. Express is a minimalistic and flexible web framework that is well-suited for building REST APIs in Node.js.
- **Request Body Parsing:** We will use `express.json()` middleware to parse incoming JSON requests.
- **Folder Structure:**
  - **/src/routes** for route definitions
  - **/src/controllers** for business logic (authentication logic, etc.)
  - **/src/services** for any external service calls, such as database operations.
  
The database will be a future concern, so for now, we will simulate user data with an in-memory array.

## Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - **Minimal Setup:** Express.js provides a lightweight and easy-to-use framework to quickly set up the REST API.
  - **Scalability:** This setup can be extended easily to support more routes and more complex functionality (e.g., JWT authentication, database integration).
  - **Community Support:** Express is widely used and has a large community, meaning it is easy to find documentation and solutions for common problems.
  
- **Cons:**
  - **No Built-in ORM:** Express doesnâ€™t come with an ORM like other frameworks (e.g., Sequelize for Node.js). However, we will implement database integration in future iterations.
  - **Basic Error Handling:** We will need to manually implement advanced error handling (validation, custom error responses) as needed.


This ADR will be revisited as the project progresses and the backend architecture evolves.

## Status 
Accepted 

## Summary

We have chosen **Express.js** to build a basic REST API, with endpoints for user authentication (signup/login). This decision is based on Express's simplicity, flexibility, and wide adoption in the Node.js ecosystem. This will serve as the foundation for further development of the backend.
